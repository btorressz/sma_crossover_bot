# sma_crossover_bot

## Overview

- **The SMA Crossover Bot is a smart contract developed on the Solana blockchain using the Anchor framework. This project was built entirely within the Solana Playground IDE, with no local environment setup required. It implements a simple moving average (SMA) trading strategy, which buys or sells assets based on the crossover of short-term and long-term SMAs.**

**Please note that this project is still under review, and feedback or contributions are highly encouraged to enhance it.**
